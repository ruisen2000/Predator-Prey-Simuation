This code simulates the behaviour of a predator-prey system in an n x n grid.
During each generation, the prey (rabbits) will age by 1, and will produce a random number (up to 11) offspring.
The predator must consume a rabbit within the same grid square if possible, or become more hungry if there are no rabbits.
The predator will also move to an adjacent grid at random.
When the rabbit reaches the maximum age, it does of old age.  Similarly, if a fox has not eaten a rabbit for enough turns and its hunger level reaches minimu, it the fox starves to death.
